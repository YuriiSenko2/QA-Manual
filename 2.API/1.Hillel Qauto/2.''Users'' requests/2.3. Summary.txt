- Failed tests:

1. Authenticated user profile data (f). (Test for a profile picture)

  The test failed since the "edition of the profile picture (*)" request didn't change default profile picture despite the 200 status code. 
  Occurs with any format, name, and size of the image.

  Actual result: string "photoFilename" fails to include "car.png" (includes "default-user.png" instead)

  Expected result: string "photoFilename" includes "car.png"

2. Modification of the user's email (f).

  Any new email is determined as already existing.
  
  Actual result: status code is 400
  Message: "Email already exists"
  
  Expected result: email is changed

*Edition of the last name - the request is successful, and the "Authenticated user profile data" request confirms
 that the last name of the user was modified, but nothing changed in the web application.
